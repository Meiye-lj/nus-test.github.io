summary: 
abstract: "Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are essential for efficient data storage and retrieval.
To prevent bugs from being introduced, DBMS developers have implemented extensive test
suites; for example, the SQLite test suites contain over 92 million lines of code. Despite these
extensive efforts, test suites are not systematically reused across DBMSs, leading to wasted
effort. Integration is challenging, as test suites use various test case formats and rely on
unstandardized test runner features. We present a unified test suite, SQuaLity, in which we
integrated test cases from three widely-used DBMSs, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and DuckDB. In
addition, we present an empirical study to determine the potential of reusing these systemsâ€™
test suites. Our results indicate that reusing test suites is challenging: First, test formats and
test runner commands vary widely; for example, SQLite has 4 test runner commands, while
MySQL has 112 commands with additional features, to, for example, execute file operations
or interact with a shell. Second, while some test suites contain mostly standard-compliant
statements (e.g., 99% in SQLite), other test suites mostly test non-standardized functionality
(e.g., 31% of statements in the PostgreSQL test suite are non-standardized). Third, test reuse is
complicated by various explicit and implicit dependencies, such as the need to set variables and
configurations, certain test cases requiring extensions not present by default, and query results
depending on specific clients. Despite the above findings, we have identified 3 crashes, 3 hangs,
and multiple compatibility issues across four different DBMSs by executing test suites across
DBMSs, indicating the benefits of reuse. Overall, this work represents the first step towards
test-case reuse in the context of DBMSs, and we believe that practitioners will benefit from
SQuaLity as a practical tool."
