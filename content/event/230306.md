summary: 
abstract: "The aspect-opinion extraction tasks extract aspect terms and opinion terms from reviews. The supervised extraction methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but require large-scale human-annotated training data. Thus, they are restricted for open-domain tasks due to the lack of training data. This work addresses this challenge and simultaneously mines aspect terms, opinion terms, and their correspondence in a joint model. We propose an Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining (ODAO) method with a Double-Layer span extraction framework. Instead of acquiring human annotations, ODAO first generates weak labels for unannotated corpus by employing rules-based on universal dependency parsing. Then, ODAO utilizes this weak supervision to train a double-layer span extraction framework to extract aspect terms (ATE), opinion terms (OTE), and aspect-opinion pairs (AOPE). ODAO applies canonical correlation analysis as an early stopping indicator to avoid the model over-fitting to the noise to tackle the noisy weak supervision. ODAO applies a self-training process to gradually enrich the training data to tackle the weak supervision bias issue. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the power of the proposed ODAO. The results on four benchmark datasets for aspect-opinion co-extraction and pair extraction tasks show that ODAO can achieve competitive or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art fully supervised methods."
